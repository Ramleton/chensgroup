# Flask MongoDB API Project

This project implements a Flask API connected to a MongoDB database to manage a collection of first names.

## Prerequisites

Before running the API, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB
- MongoDB Shell (mongosh)

Make sure pip is up to date!

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramleton/flask-mongodb-api.git
   cd flask-mongodb-api
   ```

2. **Edit setup.sh**

- Replace the value of the variable MONGO_PATH on line 8 with the path of mongosh.exe

3. **Run setup.sh**

4. **Run api.py**

## Other

I've included a postman collection of example API calls that can be imported into Postman for testing
